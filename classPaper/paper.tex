\subsection*{Abstract}
\begin{small}
Synchronicity can play an important role in facilitating tasks such as 
power minimization, data logging, time synchronization, and event detection 
in wireless sensor networks.
Achieving synchronicity in sensor networks is challenging due to their
characteristic limited node resources and communication bandwidth, node crystal frequency variations, 
and lossy communication links across multi-hop networks.

We investigate the accuracy and quality of synchronicity achieved in 
a network of wireless sensors that is inspired from synchrony observed in swarms
of biological systems such as that of synchronous fireflies or spiking of neurons.
We emulate the pulse coupled integrate and fire model embedded
in such biological swarms that is guaranteed to converge by the theory proposed
by Mirollo and Strogatz~\cite{ms90}.
Our work is motivated by a variety of recent work that demonstrates the effectiveness
of this model in wireless sensor networks. 
Hong, Cheow and Scaglione use this model to propose schemes for distributed time synchronization 
and change detection in wireless sensors networks~\cite{hcs04,tsrbc03,ssp03}.
More compelling is recent work by Lucarelli and Wang~\cite{lw04} that builds upon this, and defines 
a class of models that can converge to a synchronized state based on purely local
interactions amongst nodes in sensor networks, and thus lifts the all-to-all 
communication requirement assumed in Mirollo and Strogatz's model and 
implicit in~\cite{hcs04,tsrbc03,ssp03}

In this paper, we design a variant of Mirollo and Strogatz's 
model of synchronicity for wireless sensor networks that does not assume 
all-to-all communication.
We implement and evaluate our synchronicity algorithm on Motelab, a 38 node
cluster of MicaZ sensors deployed in the Harvard Computer Science building,
as well as on TOSSIM, a TinyOS mote simulator~\cite{hill00}.
