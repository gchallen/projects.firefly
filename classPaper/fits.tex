\section{Implementing FICA in Wireless Sensor Networks}
\label{sec:fits}

Significant changes were necessary to adapt the original Strogatz
coupled-oscillators model for use on wireless sensor nodes.  Because
Strogatz's model is well documented in the literature we offer only a brief
description here.  We then continue this section detailing the challenges
created by assumptions in the model untenable on real systems and describing
our solutions.

\subsection{The Firefly Synchronization Model}
\label{sec:fireflyModel}

Mirollo and Strogatz extend Peskin's original model for the synchronous
firing of biological oscillators.  Each node in the network is an oscillator
that periodically emits a pulse.  The internal dynamics of the oscillator at
each node, say node $i$, can be generated as a function of a state variable
$x_i(t)$ which takes values within $[0,x_{th}]$, where $x_{th}=1$, is the
threshold value. $x_i(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function that
achieves the threshold value at some time $\tau_i$. Once the threshold is
achieved, the node immediately emits a pulse, $p(t)$ and resets the state
variable to 0, i.e. $x_i(\tau_i^+)=0$.  Mirollo and Strogatz specify that
$x_i$ evolves according to $x_i=f(\phi_i)$, where $f:[0,1]->[0,1]$, is
the \emph{firing function} and it is smooth, monotonic increasing, 
and concave down, i.e., $f'>0$ and $f''<0$.
Here $\phi_i \in [0,1]$ is a phase variable such that, $d\phi / dt = 1/T$,
where T is the cycle period. Furthermore, $\phi_i=0$ when the oscillator is
at its lowest state $x_i=0$, and $\phi_i=1$ at the end of the cycle when
$x_i=1$. Therefore, $f$ satisfies $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:firingFunc} shows a typical $f$.  The pulses received at each
node will cause an increase to the state variable, thus creating an offset in
the phase of each receiving node.  This effect on the state variable is
called the \emph{coupling} between the transmit and receiver nodes.

Mirollo and Strogatz assume in their model that the oscillators have
identical dynamics, and each is coupled to all the others, and thus has
\emph{all-to-all} communication.  Recent work by Lucarelli and
Wang~\cite{lw04} builds upon this model of pulse coupled oscillators, and
shows that synchronization can be achieved purely on the basis of local
communication, thus discarding the necessity of the all-to-all communication
assumption.


\subsection{The Firing Function}
\label{sec:firingFunc}

The firing function should be monotonically increasing and concave down
according to Mirollo and Strogatz's model.  
Lucarelli and Wang suggest a variety of functions, such as linear, sine, and hyperbolic sine,  
that satisfy this constraint and guarantee synchronization.
Due to the aforementioned resource constraints on the motes, either a very simple linear firing function 
can be selected that does not require floating point arithmetic, or a strategy
is needed to linearize the computation of a non-linear firing function.

The firing function is used to compute the next position, $p_i$ on the 
firing function curve when a pulse or fire is detected. 
Let $(x,y)$\footnote[1]{
We implore the reader to resist the temptation of confusing the $x$ used 
to denote the value on the x-axis in this
context with state variable $x_i$ in section~\ref{sec:fireflyModel}. Although
the notation is confusing, we use $x_i$ to represent the state variable
in order to remain consistent with previous literature that documents Mirollo and Strogatz's model.
}
represent the position of $p_i$ before the fire is detected, 
and let $(x',y')$ represent the new position given that the pulse is detected.
It should be noted that $y$ is not stored explicitly since it can be 
computed using the firing function, $y=f(x)$.
According to Mirollo and Strogatz's model, $y'$ is $y+\epsilon$,
and $x'$ is $f'(y')$ where $\epsilon < 1$ and represents a constant increment in the y axis 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:firingFunc}), and $f'$ is the inverse of the firing function.
Therefore, in order to implement the model, the inverse of the firing 
function also needs to be computed efficiently.  
We refer to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ as the \emph{firing function constant} through
the remaining course of this paper. 

We choose a logarithm function as the firing function.  This is because
apriori it seems that a linear function will be too simple and will not provide
accurate synchronization, and secondly because we can outline a simple
way to linearize the function and compute it efficiently given integer-only
arithmetic that available on the MicaZ sensors. The derivative of $log(x)$ provides a convenient way to linearize
the function in the following way:

\begin{equation}
{dy \over dx}log(x) = {dy \over dx} = {1 \over x}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
dy = {dx \over x}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
dx = x dy
\end{equation}

The derivative allows us to implement the model in one dimension rather 
than two and does not require computing the inverse of the firing function. 
When a fire is detected, the position of the state variable on the
firing function can be computed by simply multiplying the current $x$ value 
by $dy$, where $dy$ represents $\epsilon$, the firing function constant.
Thus $x' = dx + x$ and $y' = dy + y$.
Evidently, the accuracy of this computation is influenced by the magnitude
of the $dy$ jumps.  In particular, the smaller the $dy$ values, the more accurate will
be the $dx$ value computed. Since the original model defines $\epsilon$ to be
small, specifically $\epsilon < 1$, inaccuracies introduced by using large values
of $dy$ are not a concern in this scheme.

\subsection{Implications of Implementing in a Wireless Sensor Network}

Our goal was to implement the Strogatz's Firefly Synchronization model on
networks of MicaZ ''motes''.  The MicaZ is a recent addition to the Mica
family of wireless sensor network devices.  It consists of a 7.3~Mhz
ATmega128L processor, 4KB of SRAM, 128KB of Flash memory for code and data,
and a Chipcon 2420 802.15.4/Zigbee-compliant radio operating at 2.4~Ghz.  The
MicaZ also provides a 51~pin expansion connector allowing integration with
external sensors. The MicaZ runs a small, component-based interface called
TinyOS.  

Table~\ref{fig-challenges} summarizes the main assumptions made in 
the firefly based synchronicity models, and compares this with the conditions
under which we implement FICA.
None of the assumptions made by Mirollo and Strogatz's model can be
upheld in a wireless sensor environment. Noise present in the environment
and packet collisions will introduce error in the routing of simultaneous pulse messages 
between nodes.  Backoff delays introduced by the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, 
and other radio anomalies extend communication delay and introduce a 
large measure of non-determinism in the time of arrival of pulse messages. 
Furthermore, the all-to-all communication assumption is not feasible 
in multihop networks. Therefore, the demonstration by Wang and Lucarelli~\cite{lw04}
that pulse coupled oscillator based synchronicity can still be achieved 
despite relaxing this assumption forebodes well for the goals of this paper.

Sensor mote hardware also plays a role in violating the assumptions of Mirollo and Strogatz's model. 
Crystal oscillators, are influences by factors such as temperature and humidity, 
and are seldom manufactured identically. Therefore, clock skew is unavoidable in 
the sensor motes since they all tick at different rates. 
This will cause synchronization to degrade as clocks drift apart, and the oscillators
no longer have identical dynamics. Precision will therefore decay as more time elapses between 
synchronization pulses. According to a recent study, typical crystal oscillators
are accurate on the order of one part in $10^4-10^6$~\cite{vig92}, that is two nodes' clocks
will drift apart at $1-100\mu$sec per second.

One of the main changes to Mirollo and Strogatz's model that is introduced
in our implementation is communication delay. In order to address this, we introduce
a delay in processing firing events that are detected by one cycle. This allows
us to efficiently process events in batch mode. Further details of this change
and how we implement it are provided in section~\ref{sec:fitsImplementation}.

Limited computational, energy and memory resources on the motes also constrain
the level of complexity and accuracy of computations that can be performed.
In particular, the absence of floating point arithmetic limits the choice
of a firing function.
