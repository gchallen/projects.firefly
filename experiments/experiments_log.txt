Current Experiments
-------------------
. Changed and copied TOSSIM code to bind to three differnt ports
. Vary FiringFunction constant (k): 
  15 nodes, fully-connected topologies 
  For the sake of context, k = 1/epsilon

. Vary the number of nodes

. Change the "ignore packets received" interval.

. Grid, Line, Ring topologies.

Hypothesis
----------
. FFC is influenced by number of nodes.
. Varying the ignore interval should not be too much work if correct
  ignore interval is selected.
