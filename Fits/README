Algorithms still to work on:
----------------------------
. FITS on multihop
. Fix FITS bugs on real motes.


Running for TOSSIM:
---------------------

Example on a 4x4 grid fixed topology:

(be on bash)

make pc
export DBG=usr1 (Output only relevant messages)
build/pc/main.exe -rf=../tools/topGen/grid4.4.nss 16 > ../data/gt-15-Dec-2004-1/14-Dec-2004-MOTE-16.out

Processing and Graphing the Output
----------------------------------
Here is a scenario:

tools/convertTOSSIM.pl in.file out.file
tools/processEvents.pl out.file

%% This creates one file per mode for the simulation: SQ#, Time, DIFF)
%% The file format is as follows: <datafileroot>-EVENT-MOTE

gnuplot
plot 'out.file' u 2:3   (This means plot using columns Time on x-axis and Diff on y-axis)
set yrange[0:5000000]
replot

On each of the mote files:

find -name "EVENT*" -exec tools/fitData.pl {} 0 1 \;

%% {} means use the filename one by one provided by executing fitData.pl
%% 0 1 specify column numbers where indices start at 0
%% Output is in a file by: slope y-intercept

Now process a bunch of these files together:

tools/processEvents.pl out.file EVENT-MOTE-ALL

%% This should output MoteID SeqNum Time

gnuplot
plot EVENT-MOTE-ALL u 3 1
set yrange[-15:30]
set xrange[0:1]
plot EVENT-MOTE-ALL u 3 1 w impulses;

%% Finally, you may just want to sort the data.

sort -n -k 3,3 out.file > out2.file
