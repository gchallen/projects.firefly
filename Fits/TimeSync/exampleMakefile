# 20 Apr 2005 : GWA : Makefile fragment showing how to include the FTSP
#               sources for a given project.

# 20 Apr 2005 : GWA : Defining this tells FTSP to use the SysTime interface
#               to do timing.  Originally this did not work for Telos but
#               after wiring FTSP to the MicroTimer substitute I ported to
#               Telos it seemed to.  Should be more rigorously tested, and
#               for our application falling to the 32kHz external crystal
#               (what happens when this is not defined) may be perfectly
#               fine.

PFLAGS += -DTIMESYNC_SYSTIME 

# 20 Apr 2005 : GWA : Originally the path to the VU TimeSync directory, but
#               corrected to use our modified sources.
