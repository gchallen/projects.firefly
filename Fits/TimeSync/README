Vanderbilt FTSP code.  Made some changes allowing this code to use our timers
and will need to make more to enable flexibility in root node selection.

FTSP exports two useful interfaces: GlobalTime, allowing the caller to
convert a local timestamp to a global one on request the global time.
TimeSyncInfo allows the caller to request a variety of internal information
about the state of the synchronization acheived at a given point.

exampleMakefile shows extra Makefile directives needed to use this code,
which requires including parts of the VU contrib tree.  The Makefile
directives also allow you to set the rate at which nodes running FTSP
broadcast messages, which in turn affects the time for the system to
stabilize.
