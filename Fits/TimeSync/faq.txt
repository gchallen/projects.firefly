QUESTION: 
        > do i need the skew thing?
A: you need the skew thing! it is necessary because the frequencies of the 
crystals at the different motes are slightly different. since we want precision 
in microsecond range, we need to compensate for the skew. specs for MICA2 say 
that CPU frequency should be 7.3828 MHz. In reality your mote's frequency would 
be eg. 7.3827 MHz and of a different mote 7.3829 MHz which introduces the error 
of 20 clock ticks per second. this small error would accumulate over time far 
beyond the intended precision...

QUESTION: 
        > i don't understand what is your skew!
A: using std terminology, skew would be the ratio between the frequency of the
global time crystal and the local time crystal, so that the following relation
would hold: 
        global = SKEW*local + OFFSET
where global, local are variables and SKEW, OFFSET are constants specific 
to individual motes (i.e. for the root: SKEW = 1.0, OFFSET = 0.0)

since we know that the frequencies of 2 different clock crystals are almost the 
same, SKEW_0 is a constant which is very close to one: eg. SKEW_0 = 1.0+ 10^- 5 
keeping such constant in computer is inefficient; to gain beter precision, we 
can improve by subtracting 1.0 from it, getting in fact relation for offset 
between global and local time(offset=global-local): 
    offset = SKEW_0*local + OFFSET_0  (1)
    
in order to take the error of the multiplication further down, we keep OFFSET_A
for some recent point in time (LOCAL_A) and do the following:
   a)we know that: OFFSET_A = SKEW_0*LOCAL_A + OFFSET_0 (2)
   b)we know the actual local time(local) and we want to find actual offset:
   c)just subtract equations 1) and 2):
		offset - OFFSET_A = SKEW_0 * (local - LOCAL_A)
		offset = OFFSET_A + SKEW_0 * (local - LOCAL_A)	
   d)the formula for the global time then trivially follows:		
		global = local + OFFSET_A + SKEW_0 * (local - LOCAL_A)

we choose the recent point in time(LOCAL_A) be the average of times stored in our 
linear regression table, to minimize the single measurement errors. the problem
here is with the root who stops updating LOCAL_A time after re-election which
introduces large error in multiplication after some point in time: therefore each
root needs to eventually update LOCAL_A and OFFSET_A values:
    if( (int32_t)(local - LOCAL_A) >= 0x20000000 ) ... in the code does this

QUESTION:
        > You use either Timer/Clock'0' or Timer/Clock'3' right?
        > What is the major difference between the Timers 0~3, other
        > than the frequency? Is there a big reason that you can use 
        > one but not the other? 
ANSWER:
clock0 is driven by external oscillator (32kHz) - allows for power save mode, is 
generally more stable, does not depend as much on temperature/voltage changes; 
e.g. i tried 1 hour resynchronization and got under 1ms error (60us on average) 
clock0 is used when TIMESYNC_SYSTIME is NOT defined 

clock3 is driven by the CPU clock (7.38MHz)- has better resolution (1 tick = 1 
us for clock3 compared to 1 tick = 30us for clock0) clock3 is used when 
TIMESYNC_SYSTIME is defined
